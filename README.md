### Problem Statement
Gasoline is one of the most consumed fuels in the United States and the main product of U.S.
oil refineries. Based on data from the most recent census, 92% of households own at least one
car. There’s no doubt that the United States is a country with a strong car culture, but the
connection between increasing climate volatility and driving to pick up our kids from school can
often feel abstract and overwhelming.

What gets Americans’ attention are prices at the gas pump. These prices are influenced by a
variety of factors: supply and demand, the price of crude oil, refining costs, distribution and
marketing, and taxes. Most of these can be tracked, either through data released by the U.S.
Energy Information Administration or the Federal Reserve.

Although the price of gasoline is unique in how its direction can impact consumer sentiment and
act as a superficial barometer of our economy, impacting consumer sentiment and even
presidential approval ratings, the numbers do matter. Lower gasoline prices are great for the
consumer, and arguably for the economy as a whole since many other sectors (e.g.
transportation, manufacturing) rely on gasoline to run their businesses. Higher prices may help
influence decisions around conservation and renewable energy. And whether the prices rise or
fall, the companies involved are responsible for providing value for shareholders.

Americans will continue to drive for the foreseeable future, and as such they will continue to
depend on gasoline. With all of the data available, is there a way to better understand how the
prices of this resource may fluctuate and influence the greater economy?

### Research Question
We decided to go in-depth about the following topic:

What are the causal mechanisms underlying gasoline price, crude oil price, and the DIA stock price?
